                        Psychological therapy is collaborative and depends on the therapeutic relationship as well as the concerns
                        you bring forward. Therapy is not a one-time consultation; active participation is required during and
                        between sessions. You may be encouraged to practice strategies, reflections, or exercises outside of
                        therapy to support progress.

                        Therapy may involve exploring sensitive or distressing experiences, which can bring up emotions such as
                        sadness, anger, guilt, or anxiety. This is a normal part of healing. Therapy also offers meaningful
                        benefits, including improved coping skills, emotional balance, healthier relationships, personal growth,
                        and greater overall well-being.
